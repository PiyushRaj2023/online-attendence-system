ðŸš€ My Online Attendance System â€“ Frontend! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»

I worked on the frontend of an Online Attendance System, focusing on an intuitive and interactive user experience. Some key highlights:

âœ… Dark Theme UI for a Modern Look ðŸŒ™
âœ… Responsive Design using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
âœ… Smooth Animations & User-Friendly Navigation âœ¨
âœ… Well-Structured Forms for Attendance Marking ðŸ“‹
âœ… Dashboard with Clean Data Representation ðŸ“Š

This project helped me enhance my UI/UX design skills, making interfaces both visually appealing and easy to use. Excited for more frontend challenges ahead! ðŸš€
